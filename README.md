# The Project

**streamOS** is a clone website I made following a youtube tutorial. It is coded using **HTML5** and **CSS3**

It is essentially a YouTube clone site that I added my own flair to. The main purpose of this project is because I was trying to learn CSS. I recently have started on my coding journey into the wild world of front-end development and I wanted to learn CSS since I have never used it before.

This also served as a refresher course for my limited HTML knowledge. It essentially killed two birds with one stone. You can find the project on the following places:

You can also read more about the project and my thoughts on it over on my [dev.to](https://dev.to/kurtissfrost/first-project-using-css-34k2) blog.

It also served as an excuse for me to boot up Photoshop and make my own thumbnails and avatars for the "users" who uploaded videos to the site.
